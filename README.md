## Key Features

### Product Listing
- Display a list of products. Each product should include a name, image, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.
- Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to load more products.

### Product API Integration
- Fetch product data from a mock e-commerce API like [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs).
- Handle loading states and errors gracefully.
- Implement caching and a loader for improved performance (optional but preferred).

### Shopping Cart
- Allow users to add and remove products from the cart.
- Display a cart summary with the total items and total price.
- Implement a checkout button that leads to a simple checkout page.

### Checkout Simulation
- Create a mock checkout form asking for name, address, and payment details (no real payment processing).
- On submission, display a confirmation message with the order summary.

### Authentication
- Implement user authentication (login/register).
- Only authenticated users can proceed to checkout.

### HTML/CSS
- Design a clean and responsive layout for the product listing, cart summary, and checkout page.
- Ensure proper usage of HTML and CSS to create an attractive and user-friendly interface.

### Git
- Use Git for version control.
- Include a README file with clear instructions on how to set up and run the project.

## Technical Requirements
- Use HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and React.
- Ensure compatibility with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
